# Game-AI-Visualization
My attempt at trying out a few AI techniques commonly found in video games.

## Running the program

To run the program, use the makefile provided in the directory. Simply navigate
to this directory using the Terminal and type these commands to do the following:

make - compiles the program
make run - runs the program after it has been compiled


## What exactly is this?

This program provides a visualization of how entities in a video game may act
when given specific AI algorithms to follow. More details will be provided
as the algorithms are completed.

Currently working on: Flocking Algorithm, GUI improvements
